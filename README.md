# Hi, I'm Miebi 👋
#### Web Developer and Digital Designer based in France

I'm an arts and culture enthusiast, especially when it comes to new technologies and immersive experiences. 
After working as a graphic designer at Base Design in New York, I joined Le Wagon coding bootcamp to become a web developer and extend my skills in the digital field.
