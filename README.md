# Hi, I'm Miebi 👋
#### Freelance developer and digital designer

I'm a web developer and digital designer deeply passionate about digital arts and crafting immersive experiences. Originally from France, I worked as a graphic designer in New York before returning home to complete Le Wagon's full-stack coding bootcamp in Nantes. After gaining experience as a fullstack developer in a company, I now freelance, blending my skills in design and development to craft captivating digital experiences.
