# Hi, I'm Miebi 👋
#### Freelance developer and digital designer

I'm a web developer and digital designer with a great passion for digital arts and immersive experiences. After working as a graphic designer at Base Design in New York, I enrolled in Le Wagon's fullstack coding bootcamp in France. Afterwards, I landed a job as a web developer working mainly with PHP and ReactJS, all the while deepening my knowledge of technologies through self-learning. I'm currently working on freelance projects. Feel free to reach out for a chat, a project, or anything else.
